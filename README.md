My portfolio.

Hidden tool: Add "?<colorName>" at the end of the URL to change the secondary text color to whatever you want!
  
For example, "https://svirat.github.io?red" will have the secondary text color set to red. 

Note: this only works for real color values. Adding a non-color value will keep the default secondary color, which is blue.
